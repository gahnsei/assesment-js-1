// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning =
  "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";

let annalysisOfRequirements = `This is the second step of the Dev Lifecycle. This step is to understand the required objectives of the software and the checklist of tasks it must complete.`;

let design = `This step is the third step in the Dev lifecycle. This step is to design a software that will reach the desired end goal while also achieving the individual requirements in an effective manner.`;

let implementation = `This step is the fourth step in the Dev lifecycle. This step involves implementing the design idea into actual code.`;

let testingAndIntergration = `This is the fifth step in the Dev lifecycle. This step is where a developer will run the newly created code and test to see if the desired results are achieved. If the results are optimal, the developer then goes on to integrate the software.`;

let maintain = `This is the sixth and final step in the Dev lifecycle. Once a code is up and running, it is subject to wear and tear. There are a wide range of problems that can occur for a dev after a code is up, such as: Some variables may need to be adjusted at any moment in time, source codes that were used during the original implementation step may no longer exist. These are just few of the many problems that would cause a dev to have to maintain a code.`;
